# UnlockedEditor 1 2023
This repository contains the source code of the first version of **UnlockedEditor**. Development began in 2022 and the project was no longer modified after **December 9, 2023**.

Although **UnlockedEditor 2** is significantly different today, this original codebase can still help you understand the early structure of the project and set up your own menu system.

## Notes
This has been built on UE4.27
Please keep in mind that this was my first attempt at building something like this. The code is rough and experimental, but it is preserved here for reference and learning.

- Some proprietary components have been removed from this repository.
- Third party snippets that cannot be shared have also been excluded
